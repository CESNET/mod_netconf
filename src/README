How To Setup Apache Server
--------------------------
- mod_netconf compilation requires apache2-devel and libjson-devel packages.

- run following commands in this directory
$ make
# make install

- Add following lines into the (appropriate parts of the ) Apache configuration:
LoadModule netconf_module                 /usr/lib64/apache2/mod_netconf.so

- Start Apache

- For testing, you can run test-client
  - run under the same user as Apache, or change access rights of the
    communication socket (/tmp/pconn.sock) to allow writing.
